# Li_single_cell_BMS


<img src="./Kicad_screenshots/3D_render.png" width="500" height="500">

 -This is a Battery Management System (BMS) for a single cell Li-ion or Li-Po battery. I am currently on version 1 of this design, the PCB has been ordered along with the parts and I will assemble and test it when everything arrives.


-I will be adding a BOM for this build, along with a breakdown of the price per component and the total cost to manufactur each board.


-I will also be performing thorough tests on the board to verify its functionilty and I will record the results to upload them. To accompany the tests, I am aiming to complete a Worst Case Circuit Analysis (WCCA) of my design BEFORE I assemble and test. This will help me with determining the expected operating region for each part to ensure I meet my requirments, and to ensure I am within the manufacturers limits.

# Tests to perform:
-

# Features of Version 1:
- 0-500 mA charging rate
- Over charge protection 
- Over discharge protection 
- Over current discharge protection 
- Short circuit protection
- Load disconnects when plugged in to charge
- Charging and fully charged LED status indicator

# Improvements for version 2:
- [ ] Re-arange the reference designators on the PCB silkscreen
